                <p>Billiards is a popular cue sport that has been enjoyed by people around the world for centuries. Known for its precision, strategy, and skill, billiards involves players using a cue stick to hit balls on a rectangular table, aiming to achieve a particular objective depending on the specific game variant being played. While the term "billiards" is often used interchangeably with other cue sports like pool and snooker, it traditionally refers to a group of games played on a table with no pockets, where the focus is on the interaction between the balls rather than on pocketing them. The origins of billiards can be traced back to the 15th century in Europe, and it has evolved over time into various formats, including the most commonly known versions—pool, snooker, and carom billiards.<br><br>

                The sport is often associated with social gatherings and has found its place in various cultures, from informal home games to professional tournaments. The skill set required for billiards includes precise control over the cue ball, as well as an understanding of angles, positioning, and timing. Whether played casually with friends or in highly competitive environments, billiards is celebrated for both its complexity and its accessibility, making it a beloved pastime across generations.<br><br>
                    
                Today, billiards continues to be a fixture in entertainment venues worldwide, and its professional scene, with renowned tournaments and players, remains a source of inspiration for enthusiasts. The game’s rich history, combined with its evolving rules and techniques, ensures that billiards will continue to captivate players and spectators alike for years to come.</p>

                <h2 class="indigo-text center text-darken-4">HISTORY</h2>
                <p>Billiards, a game that involves skillful use of a cue stick to strike balls on a rectangular table, has a rich and evolving history. It is believed that the origins of billiards date back to the late 15th century in Northern Europe, where it was initially played outdoors on grass courts. The game was similar to croquet but evolved indoors by the 16th century, with wooden tables and the introduction of cloth-covered surfaces. <br><br>

                By the 1600s, billiards had become a popular pastime among European royalty and nobility. It was during this time that the game began to take on its modern form, with the addition of more refined equipment, such as balls made from ivory and the cue stick used for striking. The rules and structure of the game were also gradually standardized.<br><br>
                    
                Billiards split into various forms in the 18th and 19th centuries, leading to the emergence of different disciplines. In England, the game evolved into "English billiards," which combined elements of both carom (where players aim for two balls) and pocket billiards. Meanwhile, in France, "carom billiards" became highly popular, focusing on hitting two balls in a sequence.<br><br>
                    
                In the United States, billiards grew in popularity in the 19th century, particularly in the form of "pool," a version that involved pockets for the balls to fall into. The invention of automatic ball return systems in the early 20th century made pool tables more accessible to the general public, and the game quickly spread across the nation.<br><br>
                    
                Today, billiards includes various versions such as pool, snooker, and carom, each with its unique set of rules. The sport is played recreationally and professionally around the world, with major tournaments held annually. Billiards has maintained its appeal due to its blend of strategy, skill, and precision, continuing a legacy that spans centuries.</p>

                    <p>The earliest known version of billiards was played outdoors, resembling a lawn game similar to croquet. It is widely believed that the game originated in France during the 15th century, though its exact origins are somewhat unclear. The game was initially played on grass with balls struck by wooden mallets. This outdoor version was referred to as "jeu de bille," which roughly translates to "game of balls." As the game gained popularity in the courts of European nobility, it transitioned indoors and was played on a table. The game’s shift to a more structured format was likely influenced by the growing interest in indoor recreation among the aristocracy.</p>

                    <p class="flow-text indigo-text text-darken-4">16th & 17th Centuries</p>
                    <p>By the 16th century, billiards had become an indoor pastime, especially in the French and English courts. A key development in this period was the use of a wooden table, which had a cloth surface to allow for smooth ball movement. The use of cues to strike the balls, instead of mallets, became standardized during this time. The game’s popularity spread throughout Europe, with significant influence from both French and English cultures.

                        In the 17th century, the game continued to evolve. The rules of the game became more formalized, and different versions emerged, including the creation of the "carom" game, which is played on a table without pockets. Billiards became increasingly popular among the European elite, including figures like King Louis XIV of France, who was known for hosting billiard matches at his court.</p>

                    <p>The 18th century saw further innovations in the game. In England, for example, the invention of the "pocketed" billiard table, which allowed the balls to fall into pockets, was a major step forward. This development led to the creation of a new game called "pocket billiards," or what we know today as "pool." It was during this time that the game became more standardized and formalized, with a set of basic rules being agreed upon across Europe.

                        By the 19th century, the game of billiards had spread to America, where it became hugely popular. In the United States, new variations of the game began to emerge, particularly the game of "pool." American billiard players developed a new version of the game with specific rules and a set of numbered balls, which was played on a table with six pockets. This style of billiards became the most popular form of the game in the United States and has since spread globally.

                    <p>In the 20th century, billiards took on its modern form, with the establishment of professional tournaments and international governing bodies. The rise of commercial pool halls and billiard clubs further expanded the game’s popularity, especially in America. The International Billiards and Snooker Federation (IBSF) was founded in 1971, and this helped to regulate the game on a global scale.

                    During this time, new games such as snooker and 9-ball billiards also emerged. Snooker, a game that was initially popular in the British military, became one of the most widely played forms of billiards, particularly in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth nations. The game's popularity was bolstered by the formation of professional snooker tournaments, including the World Snooker Championship. In the United States, the development of 9-ball billiards, which is played with a smaller number of balls and a fast-paced format, became widely popular.</p>

The game has kept pace with technological advancements, with innovations such as electronic scoreboards, high-definition broadcasts, and online tournaments. International competitions, such as the World Pool-Billiard Association (WPA) World Nine-ball Championship and the World Snooker Championship, attract millions of viewers worldwide.

                    Billiards has also evolved as a recreational activity enjoyed in pool halls, bars, and homes. The sport continues to bring together people of all ages, transcending cultural and geographical boundaries. Additionally, the development of cue sports has led to growing interest in related activities, such as trick shot competitions and cue-making as a craft.

                    <h5>About Me</h5>
                    <p>Billiards is a cue sport played on a rectangular table with a set of balls and a cue stick. The game involves players using the cue stick to strike the cue ball, which in turn hits other balls on the table. The goal and rules vary depending on the specific type of billiards game being played. In traditional English billiards, players attempt to score points by potting balls or executing specific shots like cannons (hitting two balls with the cue ball). In other variations, such as pool and snooker, players aim to pot balls into pockets, following a sequence of rules that define the game's objective. Billiards requires skill, precision, and strategy, as players must plan their shots, control the cue ball’s movement, and anticipate their opponent’s moves.</p>
